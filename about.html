          <h2>What it is</h2>
          <p>Tone Ladder is a live colour playground for generating stepped colour ladders that behave more like painted light than traditional UI ramps.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="about__section">
          <h2>Why it exists</h2>
          <p>Most UI colour systems treat colour like engineering: pick a base colour, then march towards white and black. The result is often predictable, flat, and strangely lifeless.</p>
          <p>Tone Ladder starts from a different premise: in painting, light has a temperature, and highlights and shadows tend to shift in hue as well as in brightness. That subtle hue behaviour is a big part of what makes colour feel rich and "real".</p>
          <p>Tone Ladder tries to capture that effect in a form UI designers can use.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="about__section">
          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <p>You give Tone Ladder a base colour and choose:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Temperature</strong> (cool ↔ warm): controls the direction of hue bias</li>
            <li><strong>Mode</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><em>Conservative</em>: usable out of the box for most product UI</li>
                <li><em>Painterly</em>: pushes further to demonstrate the effect (and occasionally challenge taste)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The preview updates live as you tweak settings. When you find something you like, you can save a snapshot to history and export the ladder as CSS tokens.</p>

        <section class="about__section">
          <h2>What to expect</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The top and bottom steps stay tinted when temperature isn't neutral — because UI often uses the lightest tones the most.</li>
            <li>Tone Ladder aims for coherence: no odd single-step surprises or wild category jumps.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="about__section">
          <h2>Status</h2>
          <p>Tone Ladder is an evolving experiment in designer tooling. If something feels off, that's useful feedback — colour perception is the whole game.</p>
